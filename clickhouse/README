Create a new machine with clickhouse.

The Clickhouse SQL script is in the platform-etl-backend repository under the `clickhouse` directory. There are two scripts, run them in the following order:

aotf_log.sql
aotf.sql

Within the Clickhouse instance copy the repository and then execute the following:

clickhouse-client --multiline --multiquery < aotf_log.sql

Copy the data from cloud storage to somewhere on the local machine.
Eg.

Use the data to populate the database

cd  <path to data>
FOLDERS=$(ls -1)
for folder in $FOLDERS; do
cat ${folder} | clickhouse-client --query="insert into ot.associations_otf_log format JSONEachRow"
done

Create the next set of tables with:

clickhouse-client --multiline --multiquery < aotf.sql

To check that the tables have been created, enter the clickhouse client (`clickhouse-client`) and run the following:

`show tables in ot`

If everything has worked correctly you should see that there are three tables listed. You can further check the number of elements with:

`select count() in ot.associations_otf_log`
